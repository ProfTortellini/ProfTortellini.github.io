    <h1>This is my page for honoring our glorious president Donald J. Trump!</h1>
    <br>
    <paragraph>Trump was born on June 14th, 1946. He was born to a successful real estate mogul in New York. Though already rich, Trump worked hard to trump his father's net worth of $100 million. He is currently worth about $3 billion. In 2015, Trump announced his bid for the republican ticket in the 2016 presidential election. Trump easily beat all other republican candidates through his stern, yet honest words. By July of 2016, Trump was face to face against Hillary Clinton. Clinton represented the elite of America while Trump represented the common American. All predictions thought Trump would win, but Trump is too powerful to listen to predictions. Trump beat Clinton with a comfortable lead in the electoral college. Trump is now regarded as one of the best presidents of the United States of America.</p>
